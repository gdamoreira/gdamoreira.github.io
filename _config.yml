  Hi, my name's Guilherme as a software engineer, I have a strong passion for technology, and I strive to ensure that my company's objectives are met by putting in my best efforts. I take pride in delivering high-quality projects on time and meeting the required standards.

  Throughout my career, I have been fortunate enough to work on diverse technology-based projects, including Project Management, Banking Systems, 3D rendering systems, systems integration, front-end and back-end development, recommendation systems, government loan systems, hospital management systems, among others. I have gained valuable experience in each of these areas, which has helped me become a better software engineer.

  My academic qualifications include two postgraduate degrees, one in Project Management and another in Engineering in Data Science. I'm particularly interested in using my knowledge in both fields to lead cross-functional teams and maximize everyone's strengths to achieve shared goals.

  I strongly believe in the importance of teamwork, and I enjoy working with people from different backgrounds to create something unique and meaningful. I believe that by combining technical skills with good management practices, we can build great things together.
